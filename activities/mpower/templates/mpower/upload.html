  <h4>About mPower</h4>

  <p>
    The mPower study is an iPhone app for monitoring the symptoms of
    Parkinson's disease (PD). The study uses a combination of surveys, tasks,
    and sensor data to investigate and track symptoms. Contributions from
    people without Parkinsons' disease are welcomed: this "control" data helps
    researchers understand what data is "normal" and what reflects the
    symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Visit the mPower website to learn
    more: <a href="http://parkinsonmpower.org/">http://parkinsonmpower.org</a>
