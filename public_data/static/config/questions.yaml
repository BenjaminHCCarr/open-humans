    public domain material. There are no restrictions placed on the access or

    TRUE or FALSE: Existing laws provide you with complete protection against
    potentially harmful uses of data you choose to share publicly as part of
    this research study.
  answers:
    A: True
    B: False
  correctAnswer: B
  explanationText: >
    While there are laws prohibiting certain types of information from being
    used to discriminate against you or harm you in other ways, these
    protections have limits. For example, the Genetic Information
    Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) makes it unlawful for employers and health
    insurance companies to discriminate on the basis of genetic information.
    However, GINA does not prohibit the use of genetic information by life
    insurance or longterm care insurance companies. Furthermore, it is possible
    that someone will ignore the law and use your information in illegal ways.
