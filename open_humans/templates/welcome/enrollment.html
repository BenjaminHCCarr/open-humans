    <h3>Enrolling in research partner studies</h3>

    <p>
      Each of our research partner studies have their own enrollment process,
      with different protocols and requirements. Research partner studies
      generally require participants to enroll themselves and be at least 18
      years of age.

            <li>
              Not all participants will generate data - because not everyone
              gets sick! Once you have a kit, only 20% of individuals get
              sick enough to submit a sample in any given season.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kits might be distributed only to a subset of participants. For
              example, in the 2014-2015 flu season kits were distributed only
              to Massachusetts and New York residents &ndash; this was to
              concentrate on more densely sampling particular geographic
              regions.

              Participants must be willing to make their genomic and other
              data publicly shared. These data are potentially identifiable
              and anonymity is not guaranteed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Genome sequencing is currently expensive. Sample collections and
              sequencing are done as resources are available. Participants are
              not guaranteed to be sequenced, and sequencing may take years to
              occur.
