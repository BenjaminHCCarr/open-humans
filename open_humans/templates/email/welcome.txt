{% load utilities %}Thank you for joining the Open Humans community!

It's our mission to help connect you and your data with researchers.
In Open Humans, you'll be able to build a profile with data you receive
from studies and commercial sources. We'll invite you to share that data
in various ways, publicly or directly with projects.

To make sure you get future emails from us, add our email to your "contacts".
Without this step our emails might be "filtered" by your email client!

------------------------------------------------------------
Add Your Data

We have many data sources you can add! Each source you add gets you a badge on
your public profile. It also helps enable more studies &ndash; researchers can
design studies more easily when they know members have data to ready to share.

Here's some quick links for adding our current sources:

{% for _, source in sources %}
- Add {{ source.verbose_name }}:
  {{ source.href_connect|full_url }}?origin=open-humans&amp;next={{ source.href_next }}
{% endfor %}

(Note: Most data sources have no special relationship with Open Humans.
Supporting data contribution from a source doesn't mean we endorse it.)

Do you have more data that we aren't specifically supporting?
Sometimes members have rich data about themselves that's more
unique (e.g. related to a medical condition they've experienced).

Our "Data Selfie" feature lets you share any file you want to upload:
{{ data_selfie_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
Public Data Sharing

Data is private by default. For each data source, you can opt to turn
on public sharing.

To enable public sharing, you'll need to join our study:
{{ public_sharing_url }}

You'll be able to turn "public" status on (and off) for each of your data
sources on your research data management page: {{ research_data_management_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
News and Updates

You've opted to not receive news and update emails. Maybe you'd like to
enable this? We really don't email much! We email to tell Members about new
studies and activities, and give updates about progress in current studies.
You can change this on your account settings page:
{% url 'my-member-settings' %}

{% endif %}
------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you again for joining Open Humans! With your help, we'll start breaking
down data silos in human health and research.

Sincerely,

Madeleine, Jason, and the rest of the Open Humans team.
