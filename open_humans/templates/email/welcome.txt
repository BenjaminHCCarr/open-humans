You've opted to not receive news and update emails. Maybe you'd like to enable
this? You can change this on your account settings page:

We really don’t email much! We email to tell Members about new studies and
activities, and give updates about progress in current studies.
{% endif %}

We believe research should go both ways: find studies to join and share data
with, and studies that will share data with you. Build a profile that connects
data across studies!

You can even choose to make some data sets public. Joining our Public Sharing
Data Study turns on the “public sharing” feature: {{ public_sharing_url }}

You’ll be able to turn “public” status on or off for each of your data sets.

Get started by visiting our Welcome page: {{ welcome_page_url }}

With your help, we’ll start breaking down data silos in human health and
research.

Sincerely,

Madeleine, Jason, and the rest of the Open Humans team.
