{% load utilities %}Thank you for joining the Open Humans community!

It's our mission to help connect you and your data with researchers.
In Open Humans, you'll be able to build a profile with data you receive
from studies and commercial sources. We'll invite you to share that data
in various ways, publicly or directly with projects.

To make sure you get future emails from us, add our email to your "contacts".
Without this step, our emails might be "filtered" by your email client!

------------------------------------------------------------
Add Your Data

We have many data sources you can add! Each source you add is a generous
contribution to science and gets you a badge on your public profile. It also
helps enable more studies because researchers can design studies more easily
when they know members have data ready to share.

Check out data sources: {{ add_data_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
Explore and Share

Once you've added data, you can start to explore and share it! We support
diverse projects to help you learn more about your data. You can also join
projects to contribute to citizen science and academic research studies.

Join projects to explore and share: {{ explore_share_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
Public Data Sharing

Data is private by default. For each data source, you can opt to turn
on public sharing.

To enable public sharing, you'll need to activate it here:
{{ public_sharing_url }}

You'll be able to turn "public" status on (and off) for each of your data
sources on your data management page: {{ data_management_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
News and Updates

You've opted to not receive news and update emails. Maybe you'd like to
enable this? We really don't email much! We email to tell Members about new
studies and activities, and give updates about progress in current studies.
You can change this on your account settings page:
{% url 'my-member-settings' %}

{% endif %}
------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you again for joining Open Humans! With your help, we'll start breaking
down data silos in human health and research.

Sincerely,

Mad, Bastian, and the rest of the Open Humans team.
