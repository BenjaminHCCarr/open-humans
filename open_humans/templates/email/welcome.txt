Without this step our emails might be “filtered” by your email client. You’ll
also need to sign up for “news and updates” on your account settings. We really
don’t email much! We email to tell Members about new studies and activities,
and give updates about progress in current studies.{% endif %}

We believe research should go both ways: find studies to join and share data
with, and studies that will share data with you. Build a profile that connects
data across studies!

You can even choose to make some data sets public. Joining our Public Sharing
Data Study turns on the “public sharing” feature. You’ll be able to turn
“public” status on or off for each of your data sets.

Get started by visiting our Welcome Page[1].

With your help, we’ll start breaking down data silos in human health and
research.

Sincerely,

Madeleine, Jason, and the rest of the Open Humans team.
