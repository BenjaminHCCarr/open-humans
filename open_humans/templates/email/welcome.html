<p>
  It's our mission to help connect you and your data with researchers.
  In Open Humans, you'll be able to build a profile with data you receive
  from studies and commercial sources. We'll invite you to share that data
  in various ways, publicly or directly with projects.
</p>

<p>
  To make sure you get future emails from us, add our email to your
  "contacts". Without this step, our emails might be "filtered" by your
  email client!

<b>Add Your Data</b>

<p>
  We have many data sources you can add! Each source you add is a generous
  contribution to science and gets you a badge on your public profile. It also
  helps enable more studies because researchers can design studies more easily
  when they know members have data ready to share.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some quick links for adding our current sources:
</p>

<ul>
{% for _, source in sources %}
<li><a href="{{ source.href_connect|full_url }}?origin=open-humans&amp;next={{ source.href_next }}">Add {{ source.verbose_name }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
  (Note: Most data sources have no special relationship with Open Humans.
  Supporting data contribution from a source doesn't mean we endorse it.)
</p>

<p>
  Do you have more data that we aren't specifically supporting? Sometimes
  members have rich data about themselves that's more unique (e.g. related to
  a medical condition they've experienced). Our "Data Selfie" feature lets you
  share any file you want to upload: {{ data_selfie_url }}
</p>

<hr>

<b>Public Data Sharing</b>

<p>
  <b>Data is private by default.</b> For each data source, you can opt to turn
  on public sharing. To enable this feature, you'll need to activate it here:
  {{ public_sharing_url }}
</p>

<p>
  You'll be able to turn "public" status on (and off) for each of your data
  sources on your data management page:
  {{ data_management_url }}
</p>

<b>News and Updates</b>

<p>
  You've opted to not receive news and update emails. Maybe you'd like to enable
  this? We really don't email much! We email to tell Members about new studies and
  activities, and give updates about progress in current studies. You can change
  this on your account settings page: {% url 'my-member-settings' %}
</p>

{% endif %}

<p>
  Thank you again for joining Open Humans! With your help, we'll start breaking
  down data silos in human health and research.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Madeleine, Jason, and the rest of the Open Humans team.</p>
