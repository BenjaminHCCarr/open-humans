<p>You've opted to not receive news and update emails. Maybe you'd like to
  enable this? You can change this on your <a
  href="{% url 'my-member-settings' %}">account settings</a>. We really don’t
  email much! We email to tell Members about new studies and activities, and
  give updates about progress in current studies.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>We believe research should go both ways: find studies to join and share data
  with, and studies that will share data with you. Build a profile that
  connects data across studies!</p>

<p>You can even choose to make some data sets public. Joining our <a
  href="{{ public_sharing_url }}">Public Sharing Data Study</a> turns on the
  “public sharing” feature. You’ll be able to turn “public” status on or off
  for each of your data sets.</p>

<p>Get started by visiting our <a href="{{ welcome_page_url }}">Welcome
  page</a>.</p>

<p>With your help, we’ll start breaking down data silos in human health and
  research.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Madeleine, Jason, and the rest of the Open Humans team.</p>
