      Humans</a>

    <p>What happens when research participants receive their data? Can they use
      it? Can they share it?</p>

    <p>Open Humans believes there's incredible potential when research studies
      give participants access to their data, allowing them to aggregate and
      combine data from various research projects.</p>
