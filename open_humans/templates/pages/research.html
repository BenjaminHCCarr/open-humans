    <h3>Public data API</h3>

    <p>
      Get started right away with data sets some Open Humans members have
      generously chosen to share publicly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Data is publicly listed on <a href="{% url 'member-list' %}">members'
      public profiles</a>, and is also available
      through our <a href="{% url 'public-data-api' %}">Public Data API</a>.
      It's very easy to use &ndash; because the API only returns public data,
      no authentication is required!
    </p>
    <p>
      Users of the API are expected to follow our
      <a href="{% url 'community_guidelines' %}#public-data">guidelines for
      using public data</a>.
    </p>
    <a href="{% url 'public-data-api' %}" class="btn btn-default"
        style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;"><b>Use our Public Data API
        </b></a>
  </div>

    <h3>Work with our members</h3>

    <p>
      Interested in more than the public data? You can easily get data
      directly from members, and to enable additional follow-up
      research (e.g. surveys or new samples). Open Humans is an open cohort
      for you to work with!
    </p>

    <p>Benefits for your study include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>API access to <b>private data</b> members choose to share directly
        with&nbsp;you</li>
      <li>working with a <b>motivated community</b> of members
      <li>ability to perform <b>additional research</b> with members</li>
      <li>see <b>your study featured</b> by Open Humans</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Create a project on our website and <b>you'll immediately be able to work
      with up to 10 members</b>. You can get started immediately! Once you're done
      drafting and testing, you'll need to contact us for approval to work
      with more members. Once approved, we can share your project with our
      members.

    <h3>Connect your study</h3>

    <p>
      Open Humans believes researchers that work with our members should
      also be committed to building the commons: we want to see research
      partners to connect their studies and return data to participants.
      By doing this, research partners commit to transparency and equity,
      and their participants can use and share the resulting data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to support researchers interested in giving raw data access
      to their participants. Reasons you might want to do this include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>see <b>your study listed</b> on Open&nbsp;Humans</li>
      <li>make your <b>participants valued</b> partners in research</li>
      <li>pursue new methods of <b>data sharing</b></li>
      <li>create a path to <b>public data</b>, shared by some
        participants</li>
      <li>see <b>your work cited</b> when other studies use your&nbsp;data
    </ul>
