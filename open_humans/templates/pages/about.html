<h2>About Open Humans</h2>

<p>
  <b>Your data is more powerful when you're a part of it.</b> Open Humans
  combines community and technology to help people access their data, explore
  it, study it, and donate it. When you're connected to your data, you have a
  potential for great good: researchers can ask you new questions, and can
  combine data from disparate data sources. Through you, they can do research
  that was otherwise impossible.
</p>

<p>
  <b>You decide when to share.</b> The data members collect is always
  private by default. Members can choose which
  <a href="{% url 'explore-share' %}">projects to share their data with</a>
  &ndash; to explore data analysis tools, or contribute it to a good cause.
  Some members even decide to make some of their data sources
  <a href="{% url 'public-data:home' %}">a public resource</a>!
  We celebrate sharing, but the decision is yours: you choose what to
  share, and who to share it with.
</p>

<p>
  <b>We are all part of discovery.</b> We believe this in a very fundamental
  sense! We can all contribute our data to research, but Open Humans offers
  more: anyone can <a href="{% url 'create' %}">create a project</a>. This
  means a patient community can create a "data commons" to combine its data,
  and bring it to research teams themselves. Developers can help everyone
  explore by sharing code to help import data â€“ or explore it. Some members
  of this inspiring community are highlighted below!
