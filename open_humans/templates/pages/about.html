        <p>Open Humans is a project of <a
          href="http://www.personalgenomes.org">PersonalGenomes.org</a> – a
          501(c)(3) nonprofit – and is funded by Knight Foundation and the Robert
          Wood Johnson Foundation.  Other groundbreaking initiatives from
          PersonalGenomes.org include the
          <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/pgp">
            Personal Genome Project</a> and the
          <a href="http://getconference.org">GET conference</a>.</p>

        <p>Open Humans aims to break down data silos in human health and
          research. We believe data has a huge potential to live and grow beyond
          the boundaries a single study or program. Our online portal allows
          members to aggregate data from the research they participate in. By
          connecting individuals willing to share existng research data about
          themselves with researchers who are interested in using that data,
          data can be re-used and built upon.</p>

        <h3>Public Data Sharing</h3>

        <p>The first Open Humans study is our "Public Data Sharing" study.
          Members who join this study will be enabled to publicly share their
          diverse research data on Open Humans - including genome, microbiome,
          and viral surveillance research data. While extremely valuable, this
          data is highly identifiable. Privacy cannot be guaranteed.
          Participants who share publicly are opening up their own biology and
          health data to create a valuable public resource.
