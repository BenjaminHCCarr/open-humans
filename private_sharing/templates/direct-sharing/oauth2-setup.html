<h3>OAuth2 authorization</h3>

<p>
  "OAuth2 authoriization" is appropriate if you're running your own website or
  app with user accounts. OAuth2 projects send their users to Open Humans to
  authorize data access on our website using an OAuth2 process. We
  expect studies to perform informed consent on their website or app.
</p>

<hr>

<h4>Features</h4>
<p>
  Here's a summary of main features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      Informed consent occurs on your app or website.</b> If your project is
      a study, we expect you to handle informed consent for your users
      before sending them to Open Humans for project authorization.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      Username information is optional.
    </b> Each member's data comes via a random project-specific member ID.
    You will not receive username access unless you request it. Not receiving
    username access can help facilitate IRB review &ndash; if data is anonymous,
    the review might be expedited.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      Request access to data sources.
    </b> Select which data sources you want to request access to. If a member
    authorizes sharing with your project, you'll immediately
    have access to any of their data from those sources via our API.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      Permission to send messages.
    </b> You can request authorization to send messages to your project
    members. This messaging does not reveal their email or username to you.
    Messages can target specific project member IDs and can contain the
    project member ID within the message. (That means you can use embed the ID
    in a custom URL for a survey, to collect additiional information from a
    member.)
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      Data access via API.
    </b> Your project will have a secret master code you use for this that must
    be kept secret. Let us know if it's compromised and we can reset it.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      OAuth2 project member API endpoint.
    </b> OAuth2 projects have an additional API endpoint for
    accessing project member data via tokens, including project member ID.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>
      Works immediately.
    </b> You can immediately use all these features, but your project is
    limited to a maximum of 10 users. You'll need to apply for project
    approval to remove this cap. Once approved, Open Humans will invite members
    to join your project.
  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once a member enrolls and authorizes your project, you'll be able to
  retrieve the data members share with you via API. If authorized, you'll
  be able to send messages directly to members.
</p>

<h4>Setting up and running a project</h4>

<ol>
  <li><p>
    <b>Create a new on-site project by going to
    <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:manage-projects' %}">your project
      management page</a>.</b> Select "Create a new on-site data request project".
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Fill in with your project details.</b> Some tips...</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        You can continue edit these fields later.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        A project must be "active" for enrollment and authorization to work.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Badges should be circular images.</b> If you don't have one,
        we'll create a default text-based badge.
      </li>
      <li><p>
        Your "enrollment URL" is what we'll direct members to go to, if they're
        interested in joining and authorizing your project.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Your "redirect URL" is used by the OAuth2 authorization process. Read
        more about OAuth2 setup below.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>
    Once it's drafted, <b>view project details</b> by click on the project's
    name in your <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:manage-projects' %}">project
    management page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Continue editing project information</b> by clicking the "Edit" button
    on <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:manage-projects' %}">your project
    management page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Get OAuth2 credentials and URLs</b> on
    <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:manage-projects' %}">your project
    management page</a>. You'll need these to set up your OAuth2 authorization
    process. Read more about OAuth2 setup below for more details.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Share the signup URL with up to 10 test users.</b> Once you've set up
    your OAuth2 authorization process, you can test user authorizations.
    Send users to the "enrollment URL" you've specified to test the entire
    process.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>How to deauthorize/withdraw:</b> a member can immediately
    withdraw/deauthorize a project on their
    <a href="{% url 'my-member-connections' %}">connections management page</a>.
  </li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Test API data access.</b>
    Read <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:api-data-access' %}">instructions for
    API data access</a> to learn how to access member data. OAuth2 projects
    can also use the OAuth2 project member API endpoint.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Test messaging (if applicable).</b>
    If you've requested authorization for messages, read
    <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:sending-messages' %}">instructions for
    sending messages</a> to learn how to send messages to your project
    members.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Request project approval.</b>
    Project approval is required to remove the 10 user cap. Once approved,
    we'll share your project with Open Humans members. For approval, we require
    any project classified as a "study" to have been reviewed and approved by
    an Institutional Review Board or equivalent ethics board.
  </p>
  <p>
    To request project approval:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        Please email support@openhumans.org with the subject
        "Request for project approval".
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Include the project's name and the project ID (this is in the project
        details page).
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        If the project is a study, please attach a copy of your current IRB
        certificate of approval (or equivalent document).
      </p></li>
    </ul>
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Closing your project.</b>
    You can close your project at any time by removing "active" status.
    The signup URL will no longer work and members won't be invited to
    join your project.
  </p></li>
</ol>

<h4>OAuth2 setup</h4>

<p>
  This is a brief overview of how to use OAuth2 credentials and URLs to
  authorize a user from your app or website. If you're not familiar with
  OAuth2, we recommend you read the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth Wikipedia article</a>
  and other online resources for general information about these processes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
    <b>Direct your user to the Authorization URL.</b> This URL should include
    the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>"client_id" set to your Client ID</p></li>
      <li><p>"response_type" set to "code"</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, for the authorization URL
    <code>https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/projects/oauth2/authorize/</code>
    and the client ID <code>ABCDEFG1234567</code>, you send your user to:<br>
    <code>https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/projects/oauth2/authorize/?client_id=ABCDEFGJ1234567&response_type=code</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>
    <b>User returns with code.</b>
    If the user authorizes your project, Open Humans will send them back to
    your "Redirect URL" with the parameter "code" set. For example, if your
    redirect URL is <code>https://www.example.com/authorize_openhumans</code>
    and the code is <code>123abc456def</code> then we'll send the user to:<br>
    <code>https://www.example.com/authorize_openhumans/?code=123abc456def</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your website or app will presumably know which user is associated with this
    code. You should immediately exchange the code for token data, which you'll
    store associated with your user's account.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Exchange the code for a token.</b>
      Your website or app needs to exchange the code for a more permanent token.
      Do this immediately: the code will expire soon after it's shared.
      Use your client ID and client secret as credentials for this transaction.
      Make sure you do this securely (use https), and always <b>keep your
      "client secret" secure</b>. No one else (including your users) should have
      access to your client secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use a POST request to the "access token URL" with the following data:
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          'grant_type' set to 'authorization_code'</p></li>
        <li><p>'code' set to the value of the code you received</p></li>
        <li><p>
          'redirect_uri' set to the same redirect URL you've specified in
          Open Humans</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything is set correctly, the Open Humans website will return JSON
      data with values for 'access_token', 'refresh_token', and 'expires_in'
      (seconds). <b>Keep this token and refresh token secure.</b> The token
      can be used to access the OAuth2 project member API endpoint to
      retrieve this member's project member ID and other data.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the following Python code fragment exchanges a code for
      token data. (This uses the
      <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">requests</a>
      library.)
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      import requests

      data = {
          'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
          'code': received_code,
          'redirect_uri': your_redirect_url
      }
      token_response = requests.post(
          open_humans_access_token_url,
          data=data,
          auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(
              your_open_humans_client_id,
              your_open_humans_client_secret
          )
      )
      token_data = token_response.json()
      access_token = token_data['access_token']
      refresh_token = token_data['refresh_token']
      seconds_before_expiration = token_data['expires_in']
    </code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>How to refresh your token.</b>
      For security reasons, tokens expire after a period of time. To request
      a fresh token, use a POST request to the "access token URL" with the
      following data:
      <ul>
        <li><p>'grant_type' set to 'refresh_token'</p></li>
        <li><p>'refresh_token' set to the refresh token you received</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything is set correctly, the Open Humans website will return JSON
      data with a new 'access_token', 'refresh_token', and 'expires_in'
      (seconds).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
