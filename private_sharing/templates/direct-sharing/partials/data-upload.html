<h3 id="data-upload">Uploading data</h3>

<p>
  A project can upload files associated with it. Upload is per project member,
  one file at a time. Files must be uploaded sequentially. Large files may time
  out while uploading. Please let us know if you'd like to return large amounts
  of data (&gt;50mb) to participants.
</p>

<p>
  The API endpoint for file uploads is
  <code>/api/direct-sharing/project/files/upload/</code>.
</p>

<h4>File upload format</h4>

<p>A POST API request would contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    As a querystring parameter or in the "Authorization" header:

    <ul>
      <li><code>access_token=&lt;{% if on_site_project %}MASTER_{% endif %}ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>

    This identifies and authorizes your project.
  </li>

  <li>
    As "multipart/form-data" fields:

    <ul>
      <li><code>project_member_id</code>: Project member ID (string)</li>
      <li><code>data_file</code>: File</li>
      <li><code>metadata</code>: File metadata (JSON formatted string, see
        below for format)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See below for example API calls using
  <a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie">httpie</a> on the command line
  and raw request examples.
</p>

{% if oauth2_project %}
<p>
  OAuth2 projects are expected to use their user-specific tokens for this API
  endpoint. The endpoint can also be used with the "master access token",
  see <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:on-site-data-upload' %}">documentation for
  on-site projects</a> for more details.
</p>
{% endif %}

{% if on_site_project %}
<h4>About the master access token</h4>

{% include 'direct-sharing/partials/about-master-token.html' %}
{% endif %}

<h4>Metadata format</h4>

<p>
  The 'metadata' POST form field is a JSON object.
</p>

<p>
  The following name/value items are always required in the metadata JSON:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>
    <code>tags</code>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    An array of strings. This should be an array of potentially helpful tags
    that describe the file (maybe useful for automated search for files on Open
    Humans), e.g. data type and format.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <code>description</code>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    A string. This should be a short string describing the file, 100 characters
    max.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  These are optionally empty, but of course we hope you fill them! For example,
  the following metadata JSON is valid:
</p>

<p>
  <code>{"tags": [], "description": "", "md5": ""}</code>
</p>

<p>
  Though we'd prefer to see some content, e.g.:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
{
  "tags": ["survey", "diet", "csv"],
  "description": "Diet survey questions and responses.",
  "md5": "156da7fc980988c51682374436849943"
}</pre>
</p>

<p>
  Recommended metadata items with reserved meanings -- use if appropriate.
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>
    <code>md5</code>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    A string. This should be an md5 hash of the file, which can be used to
    check file integrity.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <code>creation_date</code>
  <dt>

  <dd>
    A string. This should be an ISO 8601 formatted date or date + time,
    indicating when this file was created.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <code>start_date</code>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    A string. This should be an ISO 8601 formatted date or date + time, and can
    be used to indicate the start of a time range (if this file represents data
    for a particular time range).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <code>end_date</code>
  </dt>

  <dd>
    A string. This should be an ISO 8601 formatted date or date + time, and can
    be used to indicate the end of a time range (if this file represents data
    for a particular time range).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="deleting-files">Deleting files</h3>

<p>The API endpoint for deleting files is:</p>

<p><code>/api/direct-sharing/project/files/delete/</code></p>

<p>
  A project can delete files that it has uploaded to member profiles. Deletion
  requests are made per project member, for individual files or all files.
</p>

<h4>File deletion format</h4>

<p>There are three ways to delete files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>One file, by file ID (unique)</b><br>
    File ID is available in the project's API for data access.
    (Projects implicitly have access to all data for their
    project via the direct sharing API.)
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>One or more files, by matching filename</b><br>
    Filename is the file's basename, including extensions explicitly, e.g.
    'surveydata.csv'. All exact filename matches for this file basename will be
    deleted, for this project member.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Delete all files for this project member</b><br>
    All files associated with your project will be deleted for this member.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A POST API request would contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    As a querystring parameter named <code>access_token</code> or in the
    "Authorization" header:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>access_token=&lt;{% if on_site_project %}MASTER_{% endif %}ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    This identifies and authorizes your project.
  </li>

  <li>
    A JSON object request body with the project member ID (string), and one the
    follow items: 'file_id' (integer), 'file_basename' (string), 'all_files'
    (boolean). See examples below for usage.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example JSON</h4>

<p>Delete file ID #12345 for member 12345678 for this project:</p>

<p>
  <code>{"project_member_id": "12345678", "file_id": 12345}</code>
</p>

<p>Delete any files with the name 'foobar.txt' for member 12345678 for this
project. Note, file extensions are included in the basename.</p>

<p>
  <code>{"project_member_id": "12345678", "file_basename": "foobar.txt"}</code>
</p>

<p>Delete all files for project member 12345678 for this project:</p>

<p>
  <code>{"project_member_id": "12345678", "all_files": True}</code>
</p>

<h4>Examples for httpie</h4>

<pre>

# deleting a file by its name
http POST $URL \
  project_member_id='12345678' \
  file_basename='foobar.txt'

# deleting all files for a project member
http POST $URL \
  project_member_id='12345678' \
  all_files:=True
</pre>
