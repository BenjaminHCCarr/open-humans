<h3>Sending messages</h3>

<p>
  If you specify that you're requesting permission to message members when you
  create your study then you'll be able to use the "message members"
  functionality from the <a
    href="{% url 'direct-sharing:manage-projects' %}">management page</a>.
  Messages sent to project members are sent as emails but the members' email
  addresses are not revealed to you. The emails are sent from the coordinator
  email address that you specify when you set up your project. This means that
  members have the opportunity to reply to you, if they wish.
</p>

<p>
  You can specify the text <code>{% templatetag openvariable %}
    PROJECT_MEMBER_ID {% templatetag closevariable %}</code> anywhere in your
  message (multiple times, if needed) and it will be replaced with the unique
  ID that identifies the member to your project. This is useful for directing
  members to activities like filling out a Google Form in such a way that you
  can automatically match the resulting form submission to the Open Humans
  member.
</p>

<p>
  Emails sent via this method contain this footer text:
</p>

<div class="well">
  <samp>
    <p>
      This email was sent by Open Humans project "<em>project name</em>" to
      "<em>username</em>".  It has been automatically delivered. The project
      has not been given your email address. You have no obligation to reply to
      this email or take any other action that might disclose your identity.
      Open Humans did not review nor retain a copy of this messageâ€™s contents
      and is not responsible for material sent by this project. You should
      retain a copy of this message if you may need it in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you respond, the project will know your email address. Your email will
      go directly to the project's email address, this communication is not
      managed by Open Humans.
