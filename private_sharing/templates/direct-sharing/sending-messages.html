<h3>Sending messages</h3>

<p>
  This feature is only available your project was set up to request permission
  to send messages to project members.
</p>

<p>
  Messages sent to project members are sent as emails but the members' email
  addresses are not revealed to you. The "reply-to" for these emails is set
  to the "contact email" you specify for the project. This means that
  members have the opportunity to reply to you, if they wish.
</p>

<p>
  To send messages...
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
    <b>Go to <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:manage-projects' %}">your project management
    page</a>.</b>
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Click the "Send messages" button for your project.</b>
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <b>Specify which members you're messaging.</b> You can either message
    all members in your project, or specify a comma-separated list of
    project member IDs.
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Enter your message text.</b> You can specify the text
      <code>{% templatetag openvariable %} PROJECT_MEMBER_ID {% templatetag closevariable %}
      </code> anywhere in your message (multiple times, if needed). It will be
      replaced with the unique project member ID that identifies the member to
      your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Including the project member ID can be useful when directing members to
      activities which collect member-specific information. For example, in a
      Google Form the ID can be included as parameter in the URL to
      pre-populate a field in the form. This allows you to automatically
      match the resulting form responses to the Open Humans member.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      <b>Send messages.</b> Click "Send messages" to send the message to the
      specified project members. Project members will receive an email with a
      standard subject and footer. The reply-to for the email will be set
      to your project's "contact email".
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the user "joesmith" might receive the following message from
      the "Foobar Project":
    </p>
    <div class="well">
      <samp>
        <p><b>From:</b> foobar.project.contact.email@example.com</p>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> Open Humans: Message from "Foobar Project"</p>
        <p>
