<h3>On site authorization</h3>

<p>
  If you're not running a website or app with user accounts, you
  probably want "On site authorization".
</p>

<p>
  We'll present your informed consent text to members on this website.
  You'll be able to retrieve the data members share with you via our
  API.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to ask members to do something more Â­&ndash; fill out a
  survey, for example &ndash; you have the option of forwarding them to
  a URL of your choosing with their project member ID embedded in the URL.
  Using the API you can also send custom messages to each project
  member's ID (which is forwarded as an email).
</p>

<p>
  For a study, this could imply the following process:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    You direct users to your study's consent page on Open Humans. This
    presents the text of your informed consent. They may "Consent" or
    "Decline".
  </li>

  <li>
    After a member consents, they are presented with a data sharing
    request. (This is the same authorization page as presented for an
    OAuth2 project.)
  </li>

  <li>
    After a member authorizes, we send them to a URL you specify
    &ndash; e.g. a Google Form where their project member ID is a
    pre-populated form answer.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If this sounds right then you're ready to
  <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:creating-a-project' %}">create a project</a>.
</p>
