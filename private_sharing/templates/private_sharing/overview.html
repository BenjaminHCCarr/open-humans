<h2>Direct data sharing</h2>

<p>
  Open Humans members bring a multitude of data that they're ready to share
  with research studies. Follow our instructions for setting up a study or
  activity, and get started immediately on inviting our Members to share data
  with you.
</p>
<p>
  <b>It's not just data access &ndash; it's Member access!</b> You'll be able
  to invite members to your own website or form, where you can collect
  additional information and continue working with them.
</p>

<h3>How to make data requests</h3>

<p>
  To request access to data from Members (and recruit them to your study!)
  you'll need to set your project up as a study or activity. Any Open Humans
  Member can set one up!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Decide what type of interaction you want.</b>
    <p>
      We support two methods for requesting data access...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>OAuth2 authorization</b>
        <br>
        <p>
          Are you running your own website with user accounts? You probably
          want the "OAuth2" method, where you send users to authorize data
          access on our website using an OAuth2 process. The OAuth2 process
          can also be used for "social login". Running your own website
          maximimizes your ability to work with individuals, but requires a lot
          of technicial ability!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>On site authorization</b>
        <br>
        <p>
          Not a website techie? No worries! You can give us your consent
          document and we'll present it to our users on this website. You'll
          be able to retrieve the data associated with user ID codes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to ask Members to do something more Â­&ndash; fill out a
          survey, for example &ndash; you have the option of forwarding them to
          a URL of your choosing! Their user ID code can be embedded in this
          URL. That means you could (for example) send them to a Google Form
          with the user ID code in a pre-filled field.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Set up your project</b>
    <p>
      Set it up.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Request approval</b>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>What you can request...</h3>

<p>
  You'll be able to request access to any of the following data sources.
  This list evolves and expands as Open Humans supports new types of data.
</p>

<ul>
{% for source in sources %}
<li>
  <b>{{ source.1.verbose_name }}</b>
  <br>
  <p>{{ source.1.data_description.description }}</p>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
  You can also request:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Permission to send messages</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      Permission to send the Member messages. (This does not share their email
      address with you.) We know that sometimes you'll want to send updates and
      reminders!
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Access to username</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      Access to username is optional - and some activities might not want it!
      All direct data sharing is done with random, activity-specific user codes.
      Requesting access to the username implicitly grants you access to all
      public data that Member is sharing. (For many Members, this makes them
      identified or more identifiable.)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Once you set up your project, it will be immediately possible for Members to
  approve data sharing with it. Immediate access enables you to start developing
  for your project, in advance of IRB approval. Until Open Humans approves it,
  however, it won't be promoted to Members and it will be capped to a maximum
  of 10 Members.
</p>
<p>
  Contact Open Humans to request approval for your study or activity. All
  projects that are designated a "study" must have approval from an IRB or
  equivalent ethics board to be approved by Open Humans.
</p>

<h3>Accessing data</h3>

<p>
  <b>
    Note - the API is in development!
  </b>
  The following isn't currently true, but it should be true soon!
</p>
<p>
  Once Members are sharing data with you, you'll be able to immediately access
  that data via our Private Data API. Your project will have a master token
  that you can use to retrieve data from Members, associated with a
  project-specific user ID code.
</p>
<p>
  Projects interacting with OAuth2 authorization will also be able to retrieve
  the user ID code corresponding to the token their OAuth2 process generates.
  This API endpoint can also be used for "social login", enabling your users
  to log in with their Open Humans account.
</p>
